# International E-Commerce Sales Analysis

## Project Objective
This project simulates the role of a Data Analyst in an international e-commerce company. The goal is to analyze sales, customers, products, and countries to answer key business questions such as:

- Who are the top customers?
- Which products are the best sellers?
- Which countries generate the most revenue?
- What are the sales trends over time?

## Dataset
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Online Retail Dataset (UK)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)

- Real transactions from a UK-based online retailer (2010–2011)
- Fields: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country
- Format: Provided as .xlsx, converted to PostgreSQL and pandas DataFrame for analysis

## Project Architecture & Tools
The project follows a complete data analysis pipeline, using industry-standard tools:

1. **Data Import:** Loaded the dataset into a PostgreSQL database (SQL)
2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Wrote SQL queries for initial exploration and cleaning
3. **Data Extraction:** Imported query results into Python using `pandas` and `SQLAlchemy`
4. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Performed further cleaning, transformation, and aggregation in `pandas`
5. **Visualization:** Created insightful visualizations using `matplotlib`
6. **Export:** Exported results to CSV for reporting and documentation
7. **Documentation:** Documented the project with a README and visualization images

## Business Questions Answered
The analysis addresses real-world business questions, including:

### Sales
- How many orders were placed each month?
- What is the total and average revenue per country?
- What are the top 10 most sold products?

### Customers
- Who are the top 10 customers by total spending?
- Which customers purchase most frequently?
- Which customers have the highest average order value?

### Products
- Which products are most frequently returned (negative quantity)?
- Is there seasonality in product sales?

## Example Visualizations
The project includes three visualizations:
- Top 10 countries by total revenue
- Top 10 most sold products
- Distribution of sales among top products

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL) for data storage and querying
- **Python** (`pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `matplotlib`)
- **CSV/Excel** for data export
